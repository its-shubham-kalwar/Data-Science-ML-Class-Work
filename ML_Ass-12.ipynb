    "Ridge regression is a regularized version of linear regression that aims to prevent \n",
    "overfitting by adding a penalty term to the ordinary least squares (OLS) objective function. \n",
    "The penalty term is a function of the squared magnitude of the coefficients, which shrinks \n",
    "them towards zero. This penalty term is also known as L2 regularization.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, OLS regression seeks to minimize the sum of squared errors between the predicted \n",
    "and actual values without any penalty term. This can lead to overfitting when the number of\n",
    "predictors is large, and the model becomes too complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ridge regression helps to address this issue by adding a penalty term to the objective function.\n",
    "This penalty term reduces the impact of irrelevant predictors by shrinking their coefficients \n",

    "magnitude of relevant predictors, leading to some bias in the estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "The amount of regularization in Ridge regression is controlled by a hyperparameter called \n",
