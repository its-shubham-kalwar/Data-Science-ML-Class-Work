    "Ordinal Encoding and Label Encoding are two techniques used to convert categorical data into numerical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordinal Encoding is a technique that assigns each unique category a numerical value based on its order or rank. \n",
    "For example, suppose you have a dataset with a \"temperature\" feature, where \"hot\" is ranked higher than \"cold,\" and \n",
    "\"warm\" is ranked in between. In that case, you can encode \"cold\" as 1, \"warm\" as 2, and \"hot\" as 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "Label Encoding, on the other hand, is a technique that assigns a unique numerical value to each category. For example, \n",
    "suppose you have a dataset with a \"color\" feature, where \"red,\" \"blue,\" and \"green\" are the categories. In that case, \n",
    "you can encode \"red\" as 1, \"blue\" as 2, and \"green\" as 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, you would choose ordinal encoding when there is a clear order or hierarchy among the categories. For example, \n",
    "in the temperature example above, there is a clear order of \"cold,\" \"warm,\" and \"hot.\" On the other hand, you would choose \n",
    "label encoding when there is no order or hierarchy among the categories, such as in the color example above.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it is important to note that the choice between ordinal encoding and label encoding ultimately depends on the specific \n",
    "dataset and the problem you are trying to solve. In some cases, one encoding may work better than the other, or you may need to \n",
    "use a combination of both encodings."
