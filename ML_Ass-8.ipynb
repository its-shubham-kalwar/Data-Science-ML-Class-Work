    "The wine quality dataset contains various physicochemical features of red and white wine, \n",

    "\n",
    "Fixed acidity: It represents the concentration of non-volatile acids in wine. These acids are \n",
    "essential for the overall flavor balance and play a crucial role in the wine-making process. \n",
    "High levels of fixed acidity can lead to a tart or sour taste in the wine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Volatile acidity: It measures the concentration of volatile acids, such as acetic acid, in wine. \n",
    "These acids can contribute to a vinegar-like taste and spoilage of the wine. Therefore, \n",
    "low levels of volatile acidity are desirable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Citric acid: It is one of the primary acids found in wine and contributes to its overall freshness \n",
    "and balance. Wines with higher levels of citric acid tend to have a more pronounced citrus taste.\n",
    "\n",
    "Residual sugar: It refers to the amount of sugar remaining in wine after the fermentation process. \n",
    "It can affect the sweetness and mouthfeel of the wine, with higher levels of residual sugar \n",
    "resulting in a sweeter taste.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chlorides: It measures the concentration of salt in wine. It can affect the overall flavor balance \n",
    "and contribute to a salty taste in wine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Free sulfur dioxide: It is used as a preservative in wine, and its concentration can affect the wine's \n",
    "oxidation potential. Higher levels of free sulfur dioxide can protect the wine from oxidation and spoilage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Total sulfur dioxide: It measures the total concentration of sulfur dioxide in wine, including both free\n",
    "and bound forms. It is an important parameter for wine preservation and can affect the overall flavor \n",
    "and aroma of wine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Density: It represents the mass per unit volume of wine and can be used to estimate the alcohol \n",
    "content of wine.\n",
    "\n",
    "pH: It measures the acidity of wine on a scale of 0 to 14, with lower values indicating higher acidity. \n",
    "The pH of wine can affect its overall flavor balance, with wines that are too acidic being unpleasant\n",
    "to drink.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sulphates: It measures the concentration of sulfur compounds in wine, which can act as an antimicrobial \n",
    "agent and preservative. Higher levels of sulfates can contribute to a bitter taste in wine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alcohol: It represents the percentage of alcohol by volume in wine. It is a critical factor in determining \n",
    "the wine's overall taste and aroma, with higher levels of alcohol leading to a stronger and more\n",
    "pronounced flavor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quality: It is a subjective rating given by wine experts, ranging from 0 (very poor) to 10 (excellent), \n",
    "based on the overall quality and enjoyment of the wine.\n",
    "\n",
    "All these features are essential in predicting the quality of wine, as they collectively contribute to \n",

    "the distribution of the data. However, it may lead to an overestimate of the variability of the data, \n",

    "Regression imputation: This technique involves using a regression model to predict missing values based \n",
    "on the values of other variables. It can be a powerful method for preserving the relationships between \n",
    "variables and can help to reduce bias in the analysis or model development. However, it may be sensitive \n",
    "to outliers and can lead to overfitting if the regression model is not well-specified.\n",

    "Multiple imputation: This technique involves generating multiple imputed datasets and combining the results \n",
